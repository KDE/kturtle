<title>Translator's Guide to &kturtle;</title>
<para>As you probably already know &kturtle;'s programming language, TurtleScript, allows to be translated. This takes away a barrier for some, especially younger students, on their effort to understand the basics of programming.</para>
<para>When translating &kturtle; to a new language you will find, in addition to the GUI string, the programming commands, the examples and the error messages are included in the standard .pot files as used for translation in &kde;. Everything is translated using the regular tranlation method found in &kde;, yet you are strongly advised to learn a little on how to translate these (as you will aslo read in the translator comments).</para>
<para>Please look at <ulink
